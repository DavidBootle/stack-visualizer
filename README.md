# Stack Visualizer
A simple utility to let you manually manage the stack. Useful as an educational tool, but designed for helping with memory management when programming in Intel x86 Assembly for Clemson ECE 2730. Programmed and hosted in 4 hours, so don't judge too hard. Feel free to submit pull requests to fix any bugs!
